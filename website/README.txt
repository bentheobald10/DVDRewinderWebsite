Assignment for Mathew Pittman and Ben Theobald.

Our desired audience are people ignorant enough to think they need a disk rewinder, let alone a rewinding burnder (whatever that is).  These are likely to be older people (50yo +, male) who don't really know much about disks.  THe fonts are large, and everything is spaced far enough apart so they can't get mixed up.
